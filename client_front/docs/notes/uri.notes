Is there a standard way to represent a QR code across cryptocurrencies? If someone opens up their bitcoin wallet and tells me (a RVN wallet) to send coin, how does the QR code know to reject that address? I guess I'm looking for something like a URI protocol prefix, e.g. "rvn:" or "btc:" embedded in the QR code data...?

This is an example URI from Ravencoin core:

raven:RMveV3d1CGc2H84QW93g5Y8hZjUetFYcwD?amount=5.12340000&label=This%20is%20a%20label&message=This%20is%20a%20message

If you want to check a Ravencoin address, there is a byte at the beginning if you base58 decode the address.  The first byte after decoding will be 60 (decimal).   Bitcoin's first byte will decode to 0x00

THIS affects send, receive pages.
